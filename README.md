# Legal Commons
Legal Commons documents formalize and structurize the practice of many lawyers to re-use each others code. It:

  * provides a clear open license for legal code: CC-SA-BY.
  * standardizes to a formatting that is easy to adapt an patch: Markdown.
  * is easy to use with version control systems like Git, HG or SVN.
  * is easy to use with code-sharing platforms like GitHub and Gitlab.
  * makes it easy to track bugs on specific parts of the document and discuss about it.
  * makes it easy to fork the document and adapt it for the own purposes.

# Use of the license
* Mark each document with a copyright notice and with "cc-sa-by 4.0"
* When changing the document keep the original copyright notice, but add a 'contributions by: [name]' section. If there is already such a section, add your name to it.
* Use angular brackets, '[..]', to mark clearly what parts of the document needs to be filled in when using it. If one field is used on several places in the document, make sure to use one and the same name for that field, so people can sue search and replace to use it.

# Hints on working with Legal Commons
* use a version control system like Git right from the start, it really eases your life.
* You can use the program 'pandoc' to convert other file formats to Markdown, check the formatting manually.
* Use a specialized Markdown editor.
* Keep the documents in Markdown and don't convert them back and forth to other formats, by keeping the documents in Markdown it is easier to keep track of bugs and changes.
* Feel free to consume these documents. If they help you, consider contributing by improving and maintaining them. Anything from feedback, filing issues up to sending patches or making pull requests will help. And you don't need to buy us coffee but saying 'hi' when you meet us at a conference is nice. ;-)
